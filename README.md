[Fluttery](http://fluttery.ir) is a free and open-source project with aim of teaching [Google Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) to people. Fluttery is not a global project, because of language we speak. We only create [Farsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language) Contents. So this project may not be useful for those who don't speak Farsi.

# Current State
You can track the project state and activity using [Milestones](https://github.com/javadmokhtari/fluttery.ir/milestones).

# Help
We welcome any idea for improving Fluttery! If you found a bug in the project, you can simply create a [new issue](https://github.com/javadmokhtari/fluttery.ir/issues/new).
