[Fluttery](http://fluttery.ir) is a free and open-source project with aim of teaching [Google Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) to people. Fluttery is not a global project, because of language we speak. We only create [Farsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language) Contents. So this project may not be useful for those who don't speak Farsi.
